# Oi! I'm Allan Melo - @allanmelo

I'm a software developer, experience designer, maker, teacher, mentor,... 

It's a lot, I know, but some friends remember me when they see things about "Disney Imagineers". So you can understand that I do a lot of stuff, I create and assemble a lot of stuff, and most of the time those things are incredibly useful or memorable.

And why am I so sure of that? Because I've done automations for exhibitions, interactive interfaces with sensors, VR experiences, chatbots, mobile apps, games, and even voice assistants! Some of my works were in temporary exhibitions at the Museum of Tomorrow, and others are on the streets now, running in cars, on devices compatible with Alexa or Google Assistant, or smartphones and desktops.

About code: I work primarily with TypeScript or JavaScript, running on Node.js. And among the works I've already delivered, I've used Express, NestJS, Reactjs, Svelte, React Native, Flutter, A-Frame, Unity, Processing, Alexa ASK, Dialogflow, IBM Watson,... And to manage it all on AWS, Google Cloud or Digital Ocean, I also used tools like Docker, Terraform, Pulumi and Vagrant.

So... 

 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m planning to **deliver more experiential projects**.
 
 ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate in **projects that treat the user experience as a top priority**.
 
 ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help to be able to **control 100+ addressable LED strips with data from the internet** (In trouble with DMX protocols). 
 
 ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Javascript, Full-Stack Development, Backend, Docker, Dev-Ops, Sensors, Arduinos, Raspberrys, and any Artsy-tech-related stuff.
